# CS 107: Computer Organization & Systems (Not Graded)


# CS 110: Principles of Computer Systems (Graded) | 5 Units

Took [CS 110](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs110/summer-2018/) at Stanford University (Visiting Student, Summer 2018) | Graded () | Taught by Ryan Eberhardt under Professor Jerry Cain. Had so much fun Learning and Building Systems from Scratch on [Myth Machines](https://cs.stanford.edu/computing-guide/overview), where I ssh into the myth machines with my SUNet ID to perform experimentation and to subit my assignments.
